 * *traffic_light.txt* is from
   http://goobix.com/games/nonograms/?s=-946 Taken without permission
   because I'm a horrible person and really hope they don't mind me
   taking a single example to exercise it with. It's a fun site, if
   you want online nonogram time-wasting, go there!
 * *multi.txt* is my own construction, being the simplest ambiguous
   input I could construct.
